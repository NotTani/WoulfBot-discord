# WoulfBot

Written for `Woulf Shadow Gaming` on Discord.
Designed for a stateless environment (eg. Heroku), meaning that
the welcome message hard-coded. Ideally, I can change 
this in the future by backing it up with an async database of some kind.

It's currently deployed on Heroku! You can invite it to your server by
clicking 
[here](https://ptb.discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=786352124229189652&permissions=68608&scope=bot),
but you should be warned it doesn't do a whole lot at the moment!
